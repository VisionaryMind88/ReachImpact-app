You now act as a senior DevOps / Full-Stack developer specialized in Next.js (frontend), Fastify backend, PostgreSQL database, advanced API-integration (Twilio Voice, OpenAI GPT-4), and Fly.io cloud hosting deployments.

TASK SUMMARY (Professional requirements clearly):

Clearly double-check and professionally improve all existing codebase (frontend & backend); test thoroughly and ensure 100% functionality clearly works without errors. Fix immediately any frontend/backend possible existing issues clearly.
Convert clearly and professionally ENTIRE backend STRUCTURE clearly FROM SCRATCH: Move clearly away from Firebase backend clearly TO professionally set up FASTIFY RESTful endpoints/API on Fly.io platform professionally deployed (fully functional endpoints ready).
Professionally migrate all existing data and logic clearly from Firebase authentications/database/storage entirely to PostgreSQL (setup clearly integrated on Fly.io).
Configure professional Authentication/Authorization clearly implementation via JWT (JSON Web Tokens) within Fastify (no longer use Firebase Auth). Fully secure professionally set implementation done clearly production-ready.
API INTEGRATIONS (Clearly professionally secure production-keys implementation, ensure perfectly working):

✅ OPENAI GPT-4 API integration: professionally check & clearly confirm fully working perfectly.
✅ Twilio API integration professionally check & securely ensure completely valid, fully functional outbound calls & SMS perfectly production-ready.

CLEAR DATABASE MIGRATION (Firebase → PostgreSQL on Fly.io):
✅ Create clearly PostgreSQL schema professionally matching the former Firebase data clearly
✅ Fully automatic migration-scripts professionally created and clearly ready
✅ Test clearly carefully after migration, ensure entire data clearly successfully moved professionally without error, data-loss or integrity clearly compromised anywhere clearly.

DOMAIN & SSL (reachimpact.io):
✅ Professionally setup clearly new routing at: reachimpact.io/app (professionally configured clean sub-path clearly).
✅ Provide clearly exact simple step-by-step instructions (or clearly implement directly if authorized) clearly DNS-configurations quickly (Hostinger domain to clearly Fly.io), professionally secure SSL-certificate (Let's Encrypt HTTPS) setup clearly.

ASSET & FILE UPLOADS STORAGE:
✅ Professionally configure all file uploads (logos, customer files & images clearly uploads) securely clearly onto Fly.io durable storage/bucket integrated clearly perfectly seamlessly working.

GITHUB TO FLY.IO AUTOMATIC CI/CD DEPLOYMENTS:
✅ Setup clearly professionally GitHub integrated automatic deployment pipeline (clearly via GitHub Actions easily deploy directly to Fly.io fully professionally automated clearly).

FRONT-END/UI REQUIREMENTS: (highly professional clearly)
✅ Built using your existing Next.js frontend, clearly integrated professionally flawlessly Fastify backend API (fully connection functional checked).
✅ Integrate clearly final LOGO provided by me (clearly fully transparently, perfectly resolution pro integrated clearly login-screen and header clearly perfectly UI consistent).

Clearly check especially thoroughly currently non-working or problematic areas carefully:

Calendar integrated professionally (Google & Outlook sync appointments clearly perfectly)
Real-time Chat/Messages backend functionality clear real-time via Fastify/PostgreSQL
Buy AI-credits area professionally UI clear attractive color implemented perfect appearance
Ensure fully-functioning interactive demo environment professionally simulated without costs
Advanced Firebase Analytics migrated & replaced professionally compatible alternative (e.g. Plausible or custom PostgreSQL analytics implementation)
Voice-to-text campaign notes backend functionality professionally functional clearly transcription working smooth
Real-time collaboration chat bubble clearly working
Personalized Widget recommendations dashboard professionally integrated flawless clearly based usage analytics
Interactive onboarding clearly tooltip animated clearly professional implemented
Ensure flawless advanced analytics dashboard data visuals clearly from PostgreSQL (previously Firebase Analytics)
Ensure entire Fastify-API backend structure clearly great scalability clearly maintainability professionally documented well.
QUESTIONS/UNCERTAINTIES:
Clearly if you're missing any specific access information (API keys, DNS records, GitHub details, Fly.io auth keys/tokens), ASK ME EXPLICITLY clearly directly detailed precisely what access/keys you exactly require.

CLEAR DELIVERABLE FINAL RESULT (required professionally):
✅ Final professionally converted ReachImpact app fully functional, bug-free, pixel-perfect tested clearly FULLY READY production-used deployed FASTIFY backend, PostgreSQL data on FLY.IO (HTTPS secured reachimpact.io/app), automatic GitHub CI/CD deployments, fully secure and functioning Twilio + OpenAI integration deployment completely achieved professionally — NO remaining errors, 100% working smoothly immediately user-friendly.

Provide CLEAR insightful professional deployment-documentation & clear instructions summary finally deliver clearly project GitHub repository README.md clearly.
